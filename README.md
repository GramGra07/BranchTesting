# Understanding Branching in GitHub

## What is a Branch?  
A branch in GitHub is a separate version of the main codebase where you can develop features, fix bugs, or experiment without modifying the main project. Once changes are complete, they can be merged back into the main branch.

## How Branching Works in GitHub

1. **Main Branch (Default Branch)**  
   - The main or `master` branch is the primary codebase.  
   - It should always contain stable and deployable code.  

2. **Feature Branches**  
   - Developers create new branches from `main` to work on specific tasks.  
   - Naming convention: `feature-login-page`, `bugfix-typo`, etc.

3. **Merging Changes**  
   - Once a feature branch is complete, it is merged back into `main` via a **pull request (PR)**.
   - Other team members review the code before merging.

4. **Deleting Branches**  
   - After merging, branches can be deleted to keep the repository clean.
